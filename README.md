# Character-and-Word-based-Text-Prediction-and-Generation-using-RNN
This project uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for character and word-based text prediction, trained on Wikipedia data. It employs one-hot encoding for characters and FastText embeddings for words, comparing the two approaches in embedding, training, prediction, and generation.
